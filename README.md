Erlang-based html page grid editor

A page grid defines the abstract graphic layout of a printed page or visual display; e.g. columns, boxes, and other two-dimensional containers for the various text and graphic elements that make up a well-designed page. Page grids provide structural organization of content and help establish an effective "eye path" for purusing the page. The page grid also helps establish a distinct and consistent visual identity across multiple pages and instances of a publication or website.
